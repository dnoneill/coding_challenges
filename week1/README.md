In this folder is a text file named `images.txt`, the file has a list of 5 images. 
The script you are writing should download all five of the images in the file.

Some hints:
- You need to figure out how to read the txt file
- You need to figure out how to convert the file to a [list](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)
- You will need to iterate over the list
- You will need to download the url contents using a library. The library `urllib.request` will do this or another library. It is not required to use this library. If you get stuck with this library, try searching for another library/combination. Google and Stack Overflow are your friends if you get stuck here.
